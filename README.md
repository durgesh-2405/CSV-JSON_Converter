## Execute the source code/script at your system.
If the standalone GUI application is not running for you **Don't worry**.
**CSV-JSON** folder contains the script of application.

Python language is used to develop the code of this application.

Libraries used are:
    
1. To create GUI of the application: [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).
2. For reading the csv files: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/).
3. For creating the JSON File: [JSON](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html).

To run the code you will be requiring python to be installed in your system.

So, either you can install python directly to your system and use the command line or any other IDE's like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code etc.

To install python in your system:

- For Linux/Ubuntu [click here](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/).
- For Windows [click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- For macOS [click here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html).

Or, you can install Anaconda distribution to your system.

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.
The distribution includes data-science packages suitable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- For Linux/Ubuntu [click here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/).
- For Windows [click here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/).
- For macOS [click here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/).


Now, To run the script follow below steps.

Before running the script we will be requiring some libraries to be installed.
To install libraries, for windows open Command Prompt or Anaconda Prompt and run these commands.
and for linux/ubuntu open Terminal to run the following commands.

**To install pandas :**

Pandas is mainly used for data analysis.
Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel.
Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.

```
pip install pandas
```
**To install Tkinter :**

Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit.It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI.
Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X installs of Python. 
The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface.
```
pip install tk
```
**To install JSON :**

The json library can parse JSON from strings or files. 
The library parses JSON into a Python dictionary or list. 
It can also convert Python dictionaries or lists into JSON strings.
```
pip install json
```

Open command prompt or terminal at the location where you have saved the script.
**Enter the command :**
```
python csvtojson.py

```
